      <h1>Experiment information</h1>
      <p>This file is used to describe the different protocols created with the list of action the program will do while running the experiment. It doesn't describe the experiemental conditions (salt concentrations, algae...) but just the action made by the program (taking pictures, turning on lights...) </p>

      <h3 id="exp1">Experiment 1</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Laser: Used</li>
          <li>Main lamp: Used with a 12h day/night cycle</li>
          <li>Red lamp: Used for the tank picture</li>
          <li>Nikon Camera: Used for the PIV</li>
          <li>Point Grey Camera: Used to take a picture of the tank</li>
          <li>Traverse: Not used</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Created to control the main experiment, there are two timers: 12h and 1h. Every 12h, we switch between day and night. Every hour, we take first a picture of the tank with the Point Grtey, then a visualisation of the flow, ie 10 pictures of the laser sheet with the Nikon with 1s pause. The is no movement of the tank.</p>

      <h3 id="exp2">Experiment 2</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Laser: Not used</li>
          <li>Main lamp: Not used</li>
          <li>Red lamp: Used for the tank picture</li>
          <li>Nikon Camera: Used for the tank picture (change objective to the vivitar)</li>
          <li>Point Grey Camera: Not used</li>
          <li>Traverse: Not used</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Created to control the test experiment in the small tank and <b>in the dark</b>, there are two timers: 1min and 10min. During the first hour we take one picture of the tank every minute and then every 10min. The tank picutres are taken using the Nikon camera and the red lamp. </p>

      <h3 id="exp3">Experiment 3</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Laser: Not used</li>
          <li>Main lamp: Not used</li>
          <li>Red lamp: Used for the tank picture</li>
          <li>Nikon Camera: Used for the tank picture (change objective to the vivitar)</li>
          <li>Point Grey Camera: Not used</li>
          <li>Traverse: Not used</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Created to control the test experiment in the small tank and <b>in the dark</b>, there is one 30s timer.We take one picture of the tank every 30s. The tank picutres are taken using the Nikon camera and the red lamp. </p>

      <h3 id="exp4">Experiment 4</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Laser: Used</li>
          <li>Main lamp: Not used</li>
          <li>Red lamp: Used for the tank picture</li>
          <li>Nikon Camera: Used for the flow visualization</li>
          <li>Point Grey Camera: Used for the tank picture</li>
          <li>Traverse: Used</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Created to control the test experiment in the small tank and <b>in the dark</b>, there is one 1min timer.We take one picture of the tank every minute and a flow visualization every 10min, to do so we move the tank with the traverse twice to scan the whole tank and then go back to the Point Grey height. The tank picutres are taken using the Point Grey camera and the red lamp. The flow visualisation is taken  using the laser and Nikon camera</p>
